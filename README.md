# E-Vacuum Cleaner Project

## Abstract
The E-Vacuum Cleaner is a smart, mobile-controlled vacuum bot designed using an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The bot is built on a chassis kit with four 9V DC motors and an L293D motor driver for movement. A 12V DC motor powers the vacuum, which is housed in a plastic bottle with a mesh to prevent particles from reaching the motor. The bot is controlled via a mobile phone using an HC-05 Bluetooth module, allowing users to maneuver the bot and toggle the vacuum on and off. This project demonstrates the integration of robotics, IoT, and automation to create a small, efficient vacuum cleaner.

## Components Used
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Uno
- **Motors**:
  - 4 x 9V DC motors for movement
  - 1 x 12V DC motor for vacuuming
- **Motor Driver**: L293D
- **Bluetooth Module**: HC-05
- **Vacuum Body**: Plastic bottle with a mesh filter
- **Power Supply**: 12V power source
- **Chassis Kit**: 4-wheel setup
- **Wiring & Connectors**: Jumper wires, soldering materials

## Features
- Bluetooth-controlled movement and vacuum operation
- Lightweight and compact vacuum structure
- Mesh filter to prevent debris from reaching the motor
- Easy integration with mobile applications

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. Hardware Setup
1. **Chassis Assembly**:
   - Attach the 4 DC motors to the chassis.
   - Connect the wheels to the motors.
   
2. **Vacuum Structure**:
   - Cut a plastic bottle to create a vacuum chamber.
   - Attach a fine mesh inside the chamber to protect the DC motor.
   - Connect the vacuum motor to the chamber with a small tube leading to the front of the bot.
   
3. **Circuit Connections**:
   - Connect the 4 DC motors to the L293D motor driver.
   - Wire the L293D motor driver to the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the 12V DC motor to a separate power source and control it via a relay.
   - Integrate the HC-05 Bluetooth module to the Arduino for wireless communication.
   
### 2. Software Setup
1. **Install Arduino IDE**
2. **Upload Code to Arduino**:
   - Write a program to control motor movement and vacuum operation using Bluetooth commands.
   
3. **Mobile App Configuration**:
   - Use a Bluetooth terminal app or create a custom app to send movement and vacuum control commands.

### 3. Testing and Optimization
1. **Pair the HC-05 module with a mobile phone.**
2. **Send commands to move the bot forward, backward, left, and right.**
3. **Test the vacuum motor to ensure proper suction and airflow.**
4. **Optimize power consumption and stability.**

## Future Improvements
- Integrating an automatic dust detection system
- Adding sensors for autonomous navigation
- Enhancing the vacuum power and dust collection efficiency

## Conclusion
This E-Vacuum Cleaner project successfully combines robotics and automation to create a functional, mobile-controlled vacuum bot. With further improvements, it can evolve into a fully autonomous cleaning solution. This project serves as a foundational step in developing smart home cleaning robots.
